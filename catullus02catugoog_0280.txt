CRITICAL APPENDIX.

—000—

Tris sources chiefly used in constituting the text of this edition (cf. Intr.
53, 54) are as follows :-

Codex oxoniensis (O), preserved in the Bodleian Library at Oxford,
numbered 30 in the official catalogue of Latin MSS. formerly in the pos·
session of the abbot Canonici of Venice. 1t is without date, bnt was
apparently written in the latter part of 'the 14th century, and is therefore ol
about equal age with codex G. ' The book, which is in a beautiful state of
preservation, contains only the poems of Catullus. It consiste of 37 leaves
of parchment, each 27 centimeters long and 19. 5 centimeters wide. The
rectangular space on each page reserved for writing is carefully indicated by
ruling, and averages 20 centimeters long and 10. 5 centimeters wide. Each
page of the first four fascicles (of 8 leaves each) isruled to contain 31 lines
of writing, from 5.5 to 6.5 millimeters apart. Beginning with fol. 33 r.,
each page is ruled to contain 32 lines. The initial letter of each verse
is a capital, and is somewhat separated from the rest of the text, being
placed to the left of the vertical boundary line. Illuminated initials are
found at the beginning of cc. 1 (very elaborate), 2 (with considerable
tracery), 65, 68, 69, 72, 772 80, and 89. In some other instances space
was left in the text at the beginning of a poem for a large illuminated letter,
and the proper letter indicated in the margin by the scribe, but never filled
in. In other instances yet, the initial letter of a poem was omitted from
the text and indicated in the margin as a gulde to the illuminator, but no
space was left for it in the text. Poems are occasionally separated by an
interval of one verse, but often are written continuously (cf. also c. 60
fin. m). In many instances the beginning of a poem (whether divided
from the preceding poem by an interval, or not) is indicated by a paragraph
mark consisting of two slight, inclined, parallel strokes of the scribe‘s pen
just before the initial letter ; but this mark, too, is often lacking. In a single
instance (before c. 31) it is accompanied bya paragraph mark of more
formal shape, illuminated in greenish blue. A few scholia are found on
