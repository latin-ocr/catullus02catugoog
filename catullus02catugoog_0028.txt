wholly evil,a beart that could feel such an impulse, even toward
a mistaken object.

25. But however gentle his treatment of lesbia, the rivals of
Catullus found now no mercy athis hands. For them he had
but bitter scorn and anger, since he mistakenly regarded them,
and not Lesbia herself, as responsible for her downfall. Egna-
tius and his set of companions (cc. 37, 39), Gellius (cc. 74, 80,
88, 89, 90, 116), perhaps also AEmilius (c. 97), Victius (c. 98),
and Cominius (c. 108), and other unnamed lovers (cc. 71, 78⁶)
suffer on this account from the stinging lash ο1 his satire. Even
Caelius Rufus, like Quintius an early friend ol the poet (c. roo),
and like Quintius the subjectos remonstrance a short time be-
fore (cc. 77, 82), now finds no such gentle treatment (cc. 69,
71 i). Possibly, also, the apparent fling at Hortensius in c.
95. 3, who was most kiudly addressed in c. 65, may have been
prompted by personal rather than by professional jealousy.
Most significant, too (cf. 5 28), is the bolt aimed at a certain
Lesbius (c. 79). Ι

did not bring Catullus peace. The tormeut of his passion was
still raging within him, and from that he longed to find free·

himself. For this he prayed most eamestly (c. 76), aud this he
finally attained, aided partly, no doubt, by absence frorn the
country (cf. 5 29), but more by the persistency with which he
kept up the struggle within himself. It may well be, however,
that in these months ο1 mental anguish are to be found the
beginniugs of that disease that caused his untimely death. But
the conviction evidently grew upon him that Lesbia ,had not
been led astray by his false friends, but had always been deceit·
ful above all things, and with the clearer iusight came not onlya
gentler feeling toward the men he had judged traitors to friend·
ship (cf. ag. c. 58 to Caelius Rufus), but a horror and con-
tempt, now unmixed with pity, for Lesbia herself. And when
she tried once more, in the day of his reconciliation with Caesar,
