The great grief expressed in vv.
1-6 can hardly be attributed to
temporary estrangement or separa·
tion from wife or mistress, but only
to her death; cf. also v. 13 n.

7. ueterum scriptorum musae:
cf. Eur. Med. 421 μοῦσαι παλαι-
γενέων ἀοιδᾶν. The ancient poets
would be chiefly Greeks, and the
word with those following stands iu
sharp coutrast to v. 9 me, and the
following words. Manlius tries to
find distraction from his grief in the
books of the ancient (Greek) poets
(cf. Hor. Sat. II. 6. 61 nunc ueterum
libris, nunc somno et inertibus

ιι ff. Manlius, who apparently has
not heard of the afflictiou of Catul-
lus, had in the first part of his letter
begged for consolatory verses from
him, and iu the second, urged his
return to Rome, supporting his
urgency by hints about the loose
life of Lesbia during the unexplained
absence of her lover. Catullus here
and in vv. 33 ff. replies to the first
part of the letter, and to the second
part in vv. 27 fle-Manli: the read·
ing of V malz¹ can readily stand for
manli, as 61. 16 mallio, and 61. 222
maulio sufficiently show; and very
tempting is the conjecture of Mure-
tus that the happy bridegroom of
61 is now the grief-stricken widower
of 68· who turns to his friend fos
comfort in his sorrow as he had for
congratulation in his joy. Yet both
Molius and Mallius are nomino
supported by inscriptions of this age.
