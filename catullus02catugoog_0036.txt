39. At all events, the reconciliation was brought about, and
the lively pen of Catullus ceased to lampoon the great com-
mander. Some have thought, however, that Mamurra was not
included in the peace, and that the utmost Caesar could effect
in his favorite's behalf was that his personality should be there-
after thinly veiled under the pseudonym Mentula.

40. But Caesar was not to profit greatly from his new ally. Up
to the end of the year 55 ae. Catullus displays only hostility to
Caesar and the Caesarians. The reconciliation apparently took

‘ place at the house of the father of Catullus at Verona during the

winter visit of the governor to the nearer province in the early
part of the year 54 (Caes. B. G. V. 1). The only poem that ¹

The broken chain of the old love could never be welded again.
Catullus had won by absence, by sels-discipline, and most ol
all, perhaps, by real knowledge of facts in the case, the freedom
from his passion for which he had prayed (c. 76). He could
once more believe in the friendship of Caelius Rufus, and to
him acknowledge, with pain, indeed, but no longer with una-
vailing torture, his true view of Lesbia’s character (c. 58). And
