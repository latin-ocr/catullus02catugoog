died before 1330), celebrated in a few enigmatic verses (cl.
Critical Appendix ad fin.) the rediscovery ol the text of Catul-
lus ‘nnder a bushel,’ apparently at Verona. η From this MS,
or from copies of it, numerous Italian scholars, among them
Petrarch, early learned to know the poet. ‘ihe original MS.
soon disappeared, and has never been found, but two descend-
ants of it, apparently not more than one generation removed,
are preserved to us, and form the basis os the present text ol
Catullus, One of these copieS,ordinarily called G (now Nn.
14,r 37 in the National Library at Paris) was made in the year
1375, and the other, O (N0. 30 of the Canonici Latin MSS. in
the Bodleian Library) at about the same time. (Cf. also intro·

(Berlin, 1829) first established the text ol Catullus upona
scientific basis, though the two MSS. on which he mainly
depended, D and L (in the Royal Library at Berlin), are far
inferior to G and 0. These became first known to the world,

(Oxford, 1867). During the last quarter of a century, then,
the constitution as well as the elucidation of the text ol Catullus
has made its most marked advances.

55. A few os the persons distinguished by the love or by the
hatred of Catullus may conveniently be mentioned here. Some
such persons, however, as Caesnr, Cicero, and Clodius, are so
well known otherwise to the ordinary reader as to need no
biographical notice ina work os this sort. Others, like Lesbia,
have been sufficiently noticed in previous paragraphs of this

Introduction. Still others are of so little present importance,
