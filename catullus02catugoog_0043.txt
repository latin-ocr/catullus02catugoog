or are so little known to us outside the mention ol them by
Catullus, that the brief references to them in the commentary
ou the individual poems may suffice. The names of all these,
with references to ‘the poems in which they are addressed or
mentioned, may be found in the Index of Proper Names at
the end of this volume.

¹56. Itis a temptation to identify the Alfenus to whom the
remonstranee of c. 30 is addressed with P. Alfenus Varus, consul
ruffectus 39 ae, especially if he, in turn, can be identified with
the Alfenus Varus who protected Vergil’s property at Mantua
(Ecl. 1, 6, 9), who was perhaps a native of Cremona (though
falsely identified by the scholiasts on Horace with Alfenus uaJ‘er
of Sat. Ι. 3.130). For if Varus was at Cremona during the
winter and spring of 5 5-54 ac, while Catullus was at Verona
(cf. 540), we perhaps have a key to the difference in tone
between c. 30 and c. 38. From Cornificius at Rome the poet
could expect in his growing illness only written comfort, and that
is all he asks. Alfenus Varus at Cremona was within easy reach-
ing distance of Verona bya direct highway, the Via Postumia,
and might have visited Catullus in person, but did not= Hence
the deeper feeling of slight with which Catullus addresses him.

57. The ‘Pollio frater’ of c. 12. 6 is very likely the only
Pollio known to us from this period, C. Asinius, Cn. f. (born
75 ac, died 5 aa), who became praetor in 45 ac. and consul
in 40, in which year he gained a triumph over the Parthini. At
first a Caesarian, he might have been won over to the senato-
rial party after Caesar’s death, but finally cast in his lot with
Antonius, frorn whom, however, he became alienated, but
without entering the circle of the intimate friends of Augustus.
As orator, dramatic and lyric poet, historian of the first trium·
virate, and literary critic, he gained lasting fame, andis fre-
quently quoted by succeeding writers. Among his intimate
friends were Vergil and Horace; cf. Verg. Ecl. 3. 84; 43 8. 63
Hor. Carm. II. r; Sal. 1. 10. 42, 85.

58. Nothing further is known of the older brother of Pollio
