CATULLUS.

Comi moenia Lariumque litus:
ς Nam quasdam uolo cogitationes
Amici accipiat sui meique.
Quare, si sapiet, uiam uorabit,
Quamuis candi‘puella
Euntem reuocet manusque collo
ro Ambas iniciens roget morari,
Quae nunc, si mihi uera nuntiantur,
Illum deperit impotente amore:
Nam quo tempore legit incohatam
Dindymi dominam, ex eo misellae

4. Comi: in the year 59 sc, in
accordance with the Vatinian law,
Julius Caesar settled 5000 colonists
at Comum, a, town already estab-
lished under Cn. Pompeius Strabo,
and called the place Nouum Co·
mum. Como, the modern town,
lies at the southern end of the west-
ern arm os Lacus Larius (Lago di
Como), about thirty miles north of
Mediolanum (Milan).

5. cogitationes: Catullus desires
to entice his friend to visit him, and
so speaks with playlul vagueness ol
certain weighty matters that can be
. communicated only by word ol
mouth. The whole tone ol the
poem is opposed to any serious in-
terpretation of the phrase.

6. amici sui meique: the same
playful mysteriousness ol expression
is kept up here, but Caecilius un-
doubtedly interpreted it correetly to
mean that the friend was the writer
himself. So Catullus speaks ol him·
sels to Alfenus in 30. 2 as tui ami·
culi.

7. uiam uorabit: an unusual,
but perlectly intelligihle phrase, per-
haps lavored by the alliteration, and
augmenting by its exaggerated char·
aeter the playlulness ol the urgenc'y.

usual construction of rogare with ut

Bucol. 2. 70 rusticus Alcon te per·
eam: and in 45. 5 perire used
absolutely. — impotente, violent ,-
cf.4.18n.

13. quo tempore: denoting the
starting·point ol a continued aetion,
as indicated by v. 14 ex eo ,¹ cl. 68.
15 tempore quo with 68. 20, where
the continuance of activity from the
initial period is clearly indicated.—
legit: sc. ma,- she read the open·
ing verses¹ lent her by the author,
cs. 42, where Catullus was unable
to recover his tablets lent, perhapS,
under similar circumstances. The
custom of public recitation by the
author himself was introduced later
by Asinius Pollio (cl. 12. 6).

poem, or play, based on the story ol
