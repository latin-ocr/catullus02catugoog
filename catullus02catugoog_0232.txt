Flauus quam molli praecurrit flumine Mella,
Brixia, Veronae mater amata meae,

Cum quibus illa malum fecit adulterium.

Saepe illam audiui furtiua uoce loquentem
Solam cum ancillis haec sua flagitia,
Nomine dicentem quos diximus ut pote quae mi
· Speraret nec linguam esse nec auriculam.
45 Praeterea addebat quendam, quem dicere nolo
Nomine ne tollat rubra supercilia.
