addressed in c. 12. ‘lhe family of the Asinii spraug from Teate,
the capital of the Marrucini, but it is doubtful whether Marru-
cine in c. 12. r is simply a distinguishing epithet. C. Asinius

Pollio is the first ol the family known to bear a cognomen, and ,

perhaps that custom was introduced in his generation, his elder
brother taking the cognomen Marrucinus from the seat of the
family.

59. The Caelius of c. 58 is probably identical with the Caelius
of cc. 82 and 100, and with the Rufus of cc. 69 and 77 (and also
cc. 73 and 59i), the names and circumstances suggesting M.
Caelius Rufus, born, according to Pliny (N. H. VII. 165), on
the same day with C. Licinius Calvus, May 28, 82 rac. (though
perhaps this date is too late, by a few years, for the birth of
Caelius). Caelius is well known as an ambitious politician and
an orator (Cic. Brut. 79. 273 3 Quint. Inst. VI. 3. 69 3 X. r.
1153 2. 253 TacDial. 18, 21, 25). He was at first a partisan
of the optimates ; but after filling the offices of tribune (5²
nc), quaestor, and curule aedile (50 nc), and contracting im·
mense debts by his extravagant lile, he became a follower of
Caesar, and was by him made praetor for the year 48. But
being shortly thereafter deposed for attempts at revolutionary
legislation, he tried to seduce certain of Caesar’s troops, and
was finally killed under the walls of Thurii. He was an active
and interesting correspondentes Cicero, by whom he was de-
fended (56 nc.) in the famous speech pro Caelio against the
charge of attempted poisoning brought by Clodia (Lesbia),
whose favored lover he had been. He himself appears to have
broken this connection, and perhaps to have opened the eyes
of Catullus to Lesbia's real character, after which the friend-
ship was again cemented between him and Catullus which had

been severed by their rivalry (cf. ἐξ 25, 26). The poems
addressed to him were apparently written in about the follow-
ng order: cc·100‚82‚77‚ (73), ⁶9, (59), 58· '

friend of Catullus, was the son of the annalist, Licinius Macer,
