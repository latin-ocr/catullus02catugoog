4. With regard to his full name we are lest in some doubt.
He refers to· himself by name in his poems twenty-five times,
but in each case only by the cognomen, Catullus, while the
better manuscripts oi his writings are inscribed simply Catulli
Veronensis liber. Yet there is no difficulty in ascertaining his
gentile name from other writers. Varro (L. L. VII. 50), Sue-
tonius (Iul. 73), Porphyrio (on Hor. Sat. Ι. 1ο. 19), Charisius
(Ι. 97), Jerome (Cluen. a. Abr. 1930), all give it as Vulm'us.
There are sever references to his praenomen. Four os the later
and interpolated manuscripts give it in their titles as Quintus,
and until lately it was supposed that to this indication might be
added the testimony oi the elder Pliny (N. H. XXXVII. 81).
Relyiug upon such authority Scaliger went so far as to emend
c.67. 12 so as to bring in sor the unintelligible words qui te
the praenomen of the poet in the vocative, Quinte,· and his
suggestion won the approval of even so keen a critic as Lach-
’ mann. But it is' now universally conceded that the initial Q.
prefixed to the word Catullus in the passage specified from
Pliny is an interpolation, the best MS, the codex Bumber-
gensis, containing only the cognomen without prefix. There is,
moreover, positive evidence in favor of a different praenomen.
Jerome (ln), in speaking of the birth of the poet, calls him in
full C. Volen‘us Cunellus, and Apuleius (Apol. 10), whose ac-
curacy, however, in the matter of names is not above suspicion,
calls him C. Catullus. In the sace, then, os the testimony
of interpolated manuscripts only, bis praenomen must stand
established as Gaius.

5. Conceming the birthplace oi Gaius Valerius Catullus
there is abundant testimony. The titles oi the best MSS. oi
bis works call him Veronensis, and Jerome (lc.) declares him
born at Verona. In this testimony concur his admirers among
rhe poets of the centuries immediately following (eg. Ov. Am.
111. 15. 7 ; Mart. Ῑ. 61. 13 X. 103.5; XIV. 1953 Auson. Op.
²3· 1) 3 and his own writings surnish confirmatory evidence oi
the same fact. He calls himself (c. 39. 13) Transpadanus· he
