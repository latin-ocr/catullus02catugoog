or roughness, but glide along with the utmost ease and swift
grace toward their mark. But he was uo precisianist in met-
rics. His hexameters are less perfect and flexible than those
os P. Varro or of Lueretius, his elegiacs less harmonious and
melting than those oi the Augustam, his logaoedics often less
melodious than those of Horace. And newertheless his rhyth-
mical skill suggests constantly that it is the effectos great art·

Alexandrian poets, though it is not easy to determine the pre·

Part of this difficulty arise: from the meagreness of the remains

from what has already been said, the speech of every-day lii .
It will not be necessary to discuss here its phenomena in
detail. It approximates closely in general to the speech oi
Plautus and Terence and of Cicero's letters, and suggests in
some respects that of Petronius and other writers of the Silver
Age, abounding as it does in diminutives (for the expression oi
tenderness, or of scorn, or even without any proper diminutive
force), in words of Greek or of provincial extraction, in alliter-
