these proffers now made to him through, and by, Furius and

Aurelius were definitely and disdainiully rejected (c. 11),-
with a manly, not a petulant disdain, sor Catullus could not
even then forget that he had loved Lesbia.

42. This manly utterance was almost the last ol the poet's
life. A few scattered verses there may have been, closing per-

’ haps with the touching appeal written from Verona (cf. ξ 56)

to his brother-poet, Cornificius, sor a word os consolation, but
that was all; and sometime in the year 54 nc, inhis beloved
Rome, so says the chronicler, the swiltly burning candle ol his
life burned itsels out.

43. With him died the clearest, if not the richest, poet-voice
ever listed in Rome. He lacked the losty grandeur os Lucre·
tius, the polished stateliness of Vergil, the broad sympathies
os Horace. For on the one hand, he was no recluse to be
filled with heavenly visions‚ and on the other, his personality
was too intense to allow him to cultivate a tolerant spirit. Hc
delighted in lise with a vigorous animal passion. Not without
charm to him was nature in her sylvan aspect (ci. ag. ιι. 34. 9 fl),
yet his highest enjoyment was in the life os men. And this life
he did not study, as did Horace, srorn the standpoint os a
philosopher. Indeed, he did not study it at all, but simply felt
it. For he was not outside os it, but a part os it to the fullest
degree, swayed by its ever-changing emotions. Such a nature
must of necessity ever renrain in many essential aspects the
mture os a child. And such was the nature of Catullus
throughout his brief lise,—warm in quick affections, hot in
swist hatreds, pulsing with most active red blood.

Portus

44. The great majority of his· verses—all the most suc·
cesssul of them—are the direct expression of his own heart
at the moment. No poet was ever more unreserved, more
periectly ingenuous. And yet, such is the facility os his genius
and the excellence of his taste, his verses show no ruggedness
