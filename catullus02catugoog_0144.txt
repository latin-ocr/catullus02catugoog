Demonstres ubi sint tuae tenebrae.

The poem appears to be an un·
finished experiment in a not very
pleasant modification of the Phalae-
cean verse, and was perhaps, with
the accompanying fragment, 58b,
found among tbe papers of Catullus
after his death and published by the
original editor of theLa'ber. The odd
verses (end also v. 8) through v. 13,
and from that point the even verses,

. have a spondee in the second place.
In 58b, however, only vv. 1 and 9
have a spondae in the second place.
