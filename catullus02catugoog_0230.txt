Ianua, quam Balbo dicunt seruisse benigne
“ ’ Olim, cum sedesipse senex tenuit,
5 Quamque ferunt rursus uoto seruisse maligne,
Postquam es porrecto facta marita sene,
’ Dic agedum nobis quare mutata feraris
In dominum ueterem deseruisse fidem.
‘Non (ita Caecilio placeam, cui tradita nunc sum)
10 Culpa mea est, quamquam dicitur esse mea,
Nec peccatum a me quisquam pote dicere quicquam:
†Verum istius populi ianua qui te facit!
Qui, quacumque aliquid reperitur non bene factum,

from Brixia, but in her own familiar
talk with her maids in the presence
of the Door, which she treated as
if it could neither hear nor speak-
The conception of the door as a
bar in the way of would-be lovers
is familiar enough in ancient poetry
(cf. 63. 65 and Plautus, Horace,
Ovid‚ Propertius, etc. passim); Pro·
pertius (Ι. 16) also represents the
door as speaking of its experi-
ences.

1-8. The poet speaks: You have
been the trusted servant of the
newly-made husband (Caecilius),
as you were of his father (Balbus);
the latter you served faithfully (vv.
3, 4); now that he is dead (v. 6)
you know well what he would wish
you to do (v. 5 uoto), but you
have wilfully disregarded it (ser-
uisse maligne), and have entirely
changed (v. 7 mutata) your char·
acter; why have you thus aban·
doned your former habit of fidelity
to your master’s interests (v. 8)?

1. dulci uiro: cf. 66. 33 dulci
coniuge.

2. teque, etc: cf. the formal

—auctetz the word apparently oc·
curs only here and in Plaut. Amph.
6 bano atque ampla auctare lucra,
and Lucr. 1. 56 unde enanis natura
creet res, auctet, alatque.

4. ipse senex: the aged master,
in contrast to his son and heir.

5. rursus, on tlte contrary: cf.
22. 11. -uoto seruisse maligne:
observe the emphatic contrast to
v. 3 Balbo serviisse benagm.

6. porrecto: sc. in death; cf.
Prop. 11. 8. 33 uiderat informem
multa Patroclon harena porrectum.
— marita: τῖε. you have come into

the possession ofa married couple ·

(Balbus having been, therefore, a
bachelor or a widower); cf. Liv.
XXVII. 31. 5 uagabatur per ma·
ritas domos,· and on the other hand
such phrases as 68. 6 in lecto caelibe.

7. agedum: ef. 63. 78.

9. ita Caecilio placeam: the
Door is sincere in its desire to be
faithful to the husband, Caecilius,
and to be acquitted in his sight, for
it evidently views him as sinned
against by adesigning and criminal
wife ; cf. 20 ff. n.

expression in the invocation of 11. pote: see17.24n.

Scipio, Liv. XXIX. 27 ea uos omnia
bene iuuetis, bonis auctibus auxitis.
-bona ope: cf. 34. 23 bona ope.

12. See Crit. App.

13. qui . . . omnes: apparently
referring to v. 12 †popul.i.-qu⁸·
