INTRODUC'HON. wll ’

Transpadanes at Rome,-some of them making great names
for themselves in the literary world. With some of these cer· ¹
tainly a man of station prominent enough in Verona to be
later, at least, the friend of Julius Caesar, might command
interest. Under the charge of one of them he might have
placed so promising a young man as his son doubtless was.
To which one the trust fell cannot now be determined, but as
Catullus later (c. r) addresses Cornelius Nepos as the friend
and foster-father of his earlier poems, it seems not unlikely
that to his guardianship (cf. ξ 63) Catullus owed his introduc·
tion into the society of Rome.

13. The purpose of his coming thither is nowhere stated,
but may easily be divined. Rome was the school of Italy, at
least to all who could pay for her tuition. And a youth with a
poet’s soul buming within him could hardly have been content
with such schooling as a Transpadane town aflorded, even to
her wealthiest inhabitants. But whether Catullus did much
studying of a serious sort may well be doubted. It cannot be Ι
quite true that his ‘only books were woman’s looks,' for his
poems show an ardent and sympathetic study of the Greelr
poets. But his attainments in rhetoric and philosophy, if he
had any at all, were certainly not of a scholastic character, and
he apparently never cared to follow the studente of the day to
Athens orto Rhodes.

ε 14. Not books, but life, exercised over him the pre'eminent
charm. And this life was not the life of the past, but of the
present,- the busy, delirious whirl of life in the capital of the
world. Into it he plunged with all the ardor of a lively and
passionate nature. Rome was from that first moment his

¹ home, the centre of all his beloved activities. Verona, his

Sabine villa, and even Sirmio, became to him but hospitals
or vacation haunts. Once only did he leave Italy, and even
his joy at reaching Sirmio again on his return (c. 31) could

not long detain him from Rome. And at Rome death met
him.
