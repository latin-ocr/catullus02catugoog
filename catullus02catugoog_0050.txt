INTRODUCI'ION. xlv

latioris from Callimachus, but declaring from that tIme open
war, while the second asserts that Gellius had broken the bond
of friendship with Catullus by becoming a lover of Lesbia. In
c. 80. 1 the youth of Gellius is indicated, and in all the series
except c. 116 he Is charged with vari0us abhorrent crimes. The
most acceptable suggestion of his identity was originally made
by Pantagathus (ir 578), who judged him to be that sou of t.
Gellius Publicola (consul 7² nc.) who fs said by Valerius
Maximus (V. 9. 1) to have been accused before the senate of
r'n nouercam (cf. c. 88. 1, etc.) commissum stuprum et parnti-
dium cogr'tutum. This younger Gellius was himself consul in
36 nc, aud his age therefore also accords with the intimatious
of Catullus. The patruus of c. 74 is identified by some critics
with the Gellius Publicola attached by Cicero in Pro Sestio 51.
rro, while yet others have supposed, but with no sufficient rea·
son, that this Gellius, 3ηά not the one of Valerius Maximus, is
the Gellius assailed by Catullus.

73. The attacks of Catullus upon Mamurra have already
been mentioned (§ 38). That he is identical with the ‘Men-
tula’ of cc. 94, 105, 114, and 1¹5 we may be tolerably certaIn
on noting the use of that name for Mamurra in c. 29. 13, and on
comparing the wealth and extravagance of the two men (cc.

114 and 115 with cc. 29, 41, aud 43), their literary preten-
sions (c. 105 with c. 57. 7), and their licentiousness (cc. 94 3ηά
115. 7-8 with cc. 29. 7-8 and 57). These latter iudications,
however, but support that of c. 29. 13, and would not iude·
pendently establish the identity.

74. A sufficient biography of Mamurra is given by Pliny
(N. Η. XXXVI. 6. 48), who says he was 'an eques of Formiae
3ηά praefectus fabrum of Caesar in Gaul, and quotes Nepos as
authority for the statement that Mamurra first of the Romans
incrusted the entire walls of his house on the Caelian with mar·

· hle, and had within it none but solid marbie columns. Cicero,
too, mentions Mamurra's ill-gotten wealth (Art. VII. 7. 6), and
iu Art. XIII. 52. 1 (written hr 45 nc.) refers to the calm way
