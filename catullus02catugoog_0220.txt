15 Sed tamen in tantis maeroribus Ortale, mitto
Haec expressa tibi carmina Battiadae, κ

Quod. miserae oblitae molli sub ueste locatum, ⁵

Atqueillud prono praeceps agitur decursu,
Huic manat tristi conscius ore rubor.

body just below the breasts made
the upper part oi the robe a con-

small objects.

21. miserae oblitae: swith this

adverb mirere with another adjeo·

further the general impression ,oi

presses the girl’s dismay, which
makes even the swist fall oi the
apple seem to occupy a life-time.
