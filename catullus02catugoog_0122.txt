CATULLUS.

Salax taberna uosque contubernales,
A pilleatis nona iratribus pila,
Solis putatis esse mentulas uobiS,
Solis licere quidquid est puellarum
Confutuere et putare ceteros hircos?
An, continenter quod sedetis insulsi
Centum an ducenti, non putatis ausurum
Me una ducentos irrumare sessores?
Atqui putate: namque totius uobis

10 Frontem tabernae sopionibus scribam.
