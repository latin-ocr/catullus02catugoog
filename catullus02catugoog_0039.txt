he does not hesitate to employ words and figures that suggest
the earlier tragedians rather than the comediam.

47. Cicero, in his later years, professed contempt for the
whole tribe of these poetae noui (like Catullus and his friends)
who had forsaken all the traditions of Ennius (Or. 161 ς Tusc.
111.45; Att.V11.2.1); and Horace mentions Catullus but
once, and then with definite disparagement (Sat. I. ro. 19);
but even from these references it may be fairly inserted that
thc poetry of Catullus was well and acceptably known among
his immediate generation of Romans, and had not to wait till
the time of the elegiasts fora purely posthumous fame. It
was, indeed, not so very long after his death that Cornelius
Nepos ventured to rank him in quality alongside Lucretius
(Ata 12. 4). His fame, then, was contemporary with him-
self. But even a cursory examination of his extant boolr of
poems shows evidence that it was not published till after the
poet’s death. For although it has come down to us mutilated
by the accidents of time in a most unseemly manner, no muti-
lation can account for the condition of c. 58⁵, which is clearly
but a rejected trial-siretch for the poem afterward elaborated as
c. 55, and not a misplaced part of c. 55 itself (note the much
greater frequency of dactyls in the second place in the verses of
c. 58ι than of c. 5 5). Would Catullus himself have published
such a mere fragment? Still more, would he after the recon-
ciliation with Julius Caesar have published, or republished, the
poems in which Caesar is bitterly assailed? For this same reason,
if for no other, it is also impossible to suppose, with certain

critics, that Catullus himself arranged the book for publication, ¹

but was overtaken by death before it was actually published.
48. The only satisfactory hypothesis is that the book was

both arranged and published, atter the author’s death, by some r

literary friend of his at Rome, where he ordinarily kept his
books and papers (cf. c. 68. 33·3⁶)· The posthumous editor

arranged the poems in three general groups. First come sixty p

shorter poems on various themes, all in iambic or logaoedic ¹
