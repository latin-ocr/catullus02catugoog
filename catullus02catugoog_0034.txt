37. But even Sirmio could not long detain him from his loved
Rome. His reappearance among his old friends is marked by
a single poem (c. 10),whose gay and charming humor shows
that even the vicinity of Lesbia had lost its power constantly
to embitter his thoughts. And¹ to the passion for Lesbia now
appears to have succeeded that for a boy‚ Juventius, with the
charms of whose company Catullus perhaps attempted to drive
out the thoughts of his former love. How the intimacy began
we cannot tell. The Juventian gens sprang from Tusculum,
but inscriptions (C. Ι. L. vol. V. passim) show that people of
that name also lived in the neighborhood of Verona. lt may be,
therefore, that the boy came to Rome under the guardianship of .
Catullus, as perhaps Catullus, years before, under that of Nepos.
But nothing further is known of him beyond what may be in-
ferred from the poems of Catullus that concern him (cf. intro-
ductory note to c. 15). His history is interwoven with that of
a pair of friends, Aurelius and Furius, both at first friends of
Catullus, to the former of whom the poet at one time was led
to entrust temporarily the care of his ward (c. 15). The result
might have been anticipated. Juventius learned to prefer them
to Catullus, and in consequence Catullus vented his wrath upon
them in a group of bitter poems (cc. 16, 21, 23, 26), though for
Juventius he had only sorrowful remonstrance (cc. 24, 81).

no wise deeply. It was but a passing diversion, and his jeal·

With far more earnestness did he throw himself into the politi· ,
