Praesertim quibus esset irrumator

mentary on the frequent character
of Roman provincial administration.
9. nihil neque ipsis, etc: the

' three classes mentioned are the in·

habitants themselves (ipsis), the
governors (praetoribus), and the
governor’s staff (cohorti), and the
order is that of logical emphasis: —
not even the inhabitants have any·
thing; how then can governors, to
say nothing of staff, ever get any·

that the custom of riding in a litter
originated iu Bithynia, he tells us
what we learn from no other source,
—for the grammarian Probus, in
making a similar statement, prob-
ably borrowed it from him; but
the custom was common there;
