him suddenly thither from Rome, For a time this emotion

dulled his sensibility to every other. He could think of noth· ἵ

ing else. He foreswore the Muses forever‚ save to express the
hurden of his woe (cc. 68. 19 ; ⁶5· η). Το the request of the
influential orator Hortensius for verses, he could send only a
translation from Callimachus, and the story of his tears. He
must even deny (c. 68⁰) an appeal from his friend Manlius for
consolation ou the death of his wife‚- perhaps the same Man-
lius for whose happy bridal he had but a short time before
written an exquisite marriage-song (c. 61). And even when
Manlius sought to recall him to Rome by hints conceming the

scorn. Eyen now, as formerly (c. 104), he cannot malign her,
although she has sunk so deep iu degradation. In a simple,
manly way he declares the fidelity of his love lor her (c. 87),
and the condition to which he has now been brought by her
fault and not his own (c. 75). However difficult it be to asso·

ciate the idea of pure affection with a passion like his, there
is, nevertheless an appeal of truth in his solemn asseveration
at this moment of bitterest grief that his love for lesbia was
not merely the passion of any common man for his paid mis·
hess, but was as the love of a father for his son (c. 72). Not
