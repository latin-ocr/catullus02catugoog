attractions. The exclusive demand his love made upon her
grew irksome. He might be so wholly swallowed up iu love
sor her as to disregard everything else, but she was not so

As might be expected, the unsuspicious lover received her with
a burst of capture (c. 107).

restored to their old footing. Neither ol them felt precisely as
before. Lesbia had no intention os conlining hersell to Catullus
alone, but only ol numbering him as still one ol her slaves.
