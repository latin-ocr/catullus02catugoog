xxiv INTRODUCHON.

and the hope of budding fortune (cli 41), to win him back
to her, his reply was one of bitter soom lor her, though joined
with a touch os sorrowful reminiscence oi departed joys.

27. As partos the history os Catullus aster the break with
Lesbia has thus been anticipated in order to Indicate the course
os his struggle with himself, it may be well to pause here a few
moments longer to ask who this Lesbia was. That we have in
· ¹ the poems ol Catullus a real and not an imaginative sketch ol
a love-episode cannot be once doubted by him who reads.
Lesbiais not a lay figure, a mere peg on which to hang fancies,
like the shadowy heroines os Horace. That she was nh libcr-
tina, but awoman of education and of social position, is equally
clear from the passages already cited. The name Lesbia, there·

28. It was reserved, however, for the Italian scholars oi

P. Clodius Pulcher, Cicero’s foe,'wiie of Q. Caecilius Metellus
Celer, who was praetor ne. 63, then governor ol Cisalpine
Gaul, consul lor the year 60 n.c., and died in 59, not without
suspicion that his wise poisoned him (cl. Cic. Cael. ²4· 60 ;
Quint. VIII. 6. 53). Among almost all Catullian scholars of
the present century this view has found acceptance, in spite
ol the3ex‘press dissent oi a few. The general character and
course of life of this Clodia ‘ Quadrantaria’ (cl. Cic. Cael. and
