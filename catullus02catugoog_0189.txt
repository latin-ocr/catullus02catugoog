CATULLUS

[⁶⁴- ³1·

Quae simul optatae finito tempore luces
Aduenere, domum conuentu tota frequentat
Thessalia, oppletur laetanti regia coetu:
Dona ierunt prae se, declarant gaudia uultu.

Crannonisque domos ac moenia Larisaea,

Rura colit nemo, mollescunt colla iuuencis,
Non humilis curuis purgatur uinea rastris,
