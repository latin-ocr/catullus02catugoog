CRITICAL APPENDIX. 227

Codex T huaneus (T), which is oi great importance sor the text of c. 62,
is now No. 8,071 of the Latin MSS. in the National Library in Paris. It
’ is a book oi 61 leaves, each measuring ²9 by 20. 5 centimeters, and is
written ina Carolingian hand oi the ninth century. It contains the writ-
ings oi Juvenal, and oi Eugenius oi Toledo, together with extracta from
Martial, the band poem oi Catullus, and a Latin Authology. A helio·
grapbic [acsimile of fol. 51, containing some epigrams of Martial and
62. 1-22 oi Catullus, forms plate XIV. oi the Pale‘ographic des Clossiques
Latins of M.·Chatelain, and a less accurate reproduction oi the same verses
oi Catullus was published by Mr. Ellis iu his second edition.

Orthographical peculiarities, as such, are noted in this Appendix only
when th'ey occur in proper names, or are otherwise oi especial interest.

Italics are used in the variant readings to designate all letters that are
written in the MSS. in abbreviation or ligature. Where variant readings
are given in the MSS. themselves, not written aa a part os the text, but
either between the verses or iu the margin, they are enclosed in parentheses.

O denotes codex oxoniensis.

G denotes codex Sangerrnonensis.

T denotes codex T huonens.

V (codex Veronensis) denotes the common reading of 0 and G. Where
the reading oi but one oi these MSS. is given, the reading oi the other is
that adopted in the text.

The letter ω is often used to designate such readings as occur in at least
several oi the interpolated MSS. or of the earliest (Italian) editions oi
Catullus. Where the source ol a reading adopted in the text is not other·
wise noted, it is understood to be due to ω. In ascribing emendations to
individual sources the names of scholars of the present century are usually
given in the vernacular; those ol scholars of preceding centuries, with a
few more familiar exceptions, in the Latin form.
