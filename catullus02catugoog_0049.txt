(cf. § 68) is probably I. Calpurnius Piso Caesonium, consul in ἕ
58 ne. (the year of Cicero’s exile), aud in 57-55 governor ol
Macedonia, where he made an honorable record. After his re-
tum to Rome in 5 5 nc. he attempted to reply tocertain stric-
tures of Cicero uttered in his absence, and drevv down upon
himself the overwhelmiug invective pover of his adversary in
the famous speech In It'sonem, in which the whole life, char-

71. The service of Catullus on the staff of C. Memmius,
governor of Bithynia, has already been discussed (ξ 29 u).
Conceming Memmius himself we may add further that neither
hIs political nor his personal character vas above reproach.
He was in 54 ne. party to a most barefaced attempt to secure
the consulship by bribIng the consuls of that year (Cic. Att.
IV. 18. π), and vas charged with the seduction of the wives
of Lucullus (Cic. Art. Ι. 18. 3) and Pompey (Suet. Gram.

patron of literary men, especially of Lucretius, who dedicated
his great poem to him. Cicero (Brut. 7ο. ²47) speaks vell
of hIs Greek scholarship, aud of his ability in oratory, though
blaming him for laclr of application. Accused of ambires in
53 nc, on account of the operations of the preceding year,
he went into exile in Greece (cf. Cic. Fam. XIII. 1),where he
died about the year 49.

72. Prominent among the invective poems of Catullus is a
group directed against a certain Gellius. This comprises cc. 74,
80, 88, 89, 90, 91, 116, but the poems are not arranged in
chronological order. Apparently the earliest iu composition is
c. 116, and the second c. 91, — the first indicating that Catullus
had tried to avert the hostility of Gellius by sending hIm trans ’
