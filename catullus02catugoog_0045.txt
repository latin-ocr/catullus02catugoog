and was born May 28, 82 sc. (cs. Plin. ta). He died in, or
not very long before, the year 47 nc. (cf. Cic. Fam. XV. 21, 2
4). He was renowned as a most able and skilful orator, i
though of low stature (cs. 53. 53 Sen. Caatr. VII. 4. 7 ; Ov.
Trist. II. 431), and as a writer of epic, lyric, and epigram (cs.
Cic. Brut. 279, 2833 Tac. Dial. 183 Quint. last. X. r. 1153

PlinEp. I. 16.5; Gell. XIX. 9.7 ; Serv. on Verg. Ecl. 6. 47 ;
8. 4). On account of his intimacy with Catullus and the sirni-
larity ol their political principles (ci. Suet. Iul. 73) and oi
their writings they are osten named together (cs. with above
Hor. Sat. Ι. 10. 19, and indexes to Propertius and Ovid).
The few extant fragments ol his works are appended to the κ
editions oi Catullus by Lachmann and L. Mtiller. The death oi
Quintilia, apparently from the tone os c. 96 the wife of Calvus,
gave occasion for one os the finest and most touching of the
brieter poems of Catullus.
⁶1. The Comificius to whom Catullus addressed the pathetic
appeal of c. 38 was a poet (cf. vv. 7 and 8), and is doubtless
to be identified with the Cornificius mentioned by Ovid (Trist.
II. 436) in connection with other verse-writers os the period ol
Catullus. It is not so clear, though quite possible, that he is
the Q. Cornificius to whom Cicero wrote friendly letters (Fam.
XII. 17-30), dated between 45 and 43 nc. This Comificius
was an active officer of Julius Caesar, a member os the col-
lege of augurs, and later governor os the province os Asn'ca,
which he endeavored to hold against T. Sextius, the general
of the second triumvirate. His death is mentioned by Jerome
under date os 41 B.c.: Cornificius poeto o militibus desertas
intersit, quos saepe fiagientes ‘galeatos lepores' adpellarat. Ii
this be the friend os Catullus, he may perhaps be counted as
· another of the group oi young writers won over by Caesar srom
the ranks of his political soes. His interest and activity in
rhetorical studies are distinctly indicated by Cicer0, and there
seems to be no good reason to doubt that he is the Cornificius
rhetor not infrequently quoted by Quintilian. With but slightly
