226 CRITICAL APPENDIX.

the first and second pages, aad again on iol. 21 r, on the opening verses
of c. 6 .

In a4poclret inside the back cover oi the book are five sheets of note·
paper ol four pages each containing variant readings, and headed Varie

lectiones cod· ms· catulli memb,- r‘n fi scc- XIV· apud Ab· Canonicr' cum i

edit· Aldina 1502 collati. Just below and to the right on the same page
iswritten, apparently by the same hand, but at a later date, coeperam in
gratiam Laurentii Santem'c', sednon absolui, neque ei misi quicquam.
The first ol these readings isarido modo . . (1. 2), and the last (appar-
ently) sanna esset nunc quod gannit. . (83. 4).

A lacsimlle oi iol. 26 u.(64. 336-366) by the collotype process is given
in the edition oi Catullus by Robinson Ellis (Oxlord, 1878²); lacsimiles ol
iol. 13r. (50. 3-51. 12) and fol. aou. (63. 57-87) were published by Mt.
Ellis in his XII. Facsimilcs from Latin MSS. r'n the Bodleian Library

(1885); a reduced lacsimile ol iol. 21 r. follows the preiace to this volume,
and since it has passed through the press a iacsimile oi the same page by
the heliographic process has come to hand as plate XVn in the Pale‘o·
graphie des Classiques Latim oi M. Chatelain (Paris, 1892).

Codex Sangermanensr's (G), now N0.14,1370f the Latin MSS. in the
National Library in Paris, formerly No.1,165 in the library oi the abbey
of St-GermaindesPres. Its subscription shows it to have been written in
the year 13753 and even if the words et cetera there occurring are taken

asan indication that its scribe was but copying from a longer subscription ol

· the year 1375, the style ol the writing shows that this copy could not have
been made much later than that date. The book contains the works ol
Catullus only, and is described by Schwabe as consisting of 36 leaves ol

parchment, each 243 centimeters long' and 16.9 centimeters wide, with 33 ,

lines of writing on a page. The last page, however, contains 34 lines.
The text presents many erasures and corrections, the very large majority ol
which, at any rate, were made either by the original copyist, or by another

not far removed frorn him in time. The copyist oi Gseerns to have been ¹

somewhat more sophisticated than the copyist oi 0, and (as the subscrip·
tion also intimates) to have been more worried about the condition of the
text he was reproducing. The result is that the more ignorant blundets
committed or perpetuated in 0 are often the better gulde to the readings
oi the common original ol the two MSS. A heliographic lacsimile oi two
adjoining pages ol G, fol. 35 u. and 36r. (110. 7-116. 8), forms plate XV.

in the Pale‘ograpbie des Classiques Latine of M. Chatelain, and the entire ,

Ms. has recently been reproduced in excellent {acsimile by a photolitho
¹ graphio process (Paris, Leroux, 1890).
