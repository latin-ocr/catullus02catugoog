INTRODUCTION· xix

taintness that seizes upon him even while he ieels himself a
god, and more than a god, in sharing her smile and her voice.
And with the swift passion comes the mad desire to win her
love. Lesbia is a married woman (c. 83. 1), but that consider·
ation demands only additional care and diplomacy on his part,
and is no bar to his efforts. He lays siege to her heart. His
importunate persistence, youth as he is, commands her attention
even amid a throng ol lovers, but apparently only irritates her.
What does this youngster, lately come to Rome, hope sor amid
so many ol his betters? He sees that victory must be won over
this brilliant woman of the world by proving himself no mere
moon-cali. Theresore he curhs his sentiment, and matches wit

unrestrainedly in aseries os charming trifles. Mese childlike
delight in multitudinous kisses (cc. 5, 7), daintiest pretence ol
lover's iealousy at the favors accorded lesbia's sparrow (c. a),
gentle, hall-smiling sympathy with her over the untimely death
oi her pet (c. 3), flow lrom his pen with a perfect lreedom ol
movement and yet with an exquisite grace and perlection in
every part. And the mere thought that any proud damsel could
once claim comparison with his Lesbia rouses him to hot scorn

(cc. 43, 86).

18. The sight oi this young poet at her leet may have been
attractive to Lesbia, but it could not take the place of all other
