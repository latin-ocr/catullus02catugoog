possessed a villa at Sirmio on the shore ol Lacus Benacus near

6. The year os his birth and that os his death are stated by
Jerome in his edition ol the Chronicles os Eusebius, probably
on the authority of the De Poetis ol Suetonius. Under date ol

’ the year of Abraham 1930 (= nc. 87) Jerome says, Gaius

Valerius Catullus scriptor lyricus Veronae nascitur, and under
that os 1960, or, according to some MSS, 1959 (= ac. 57, or
58), he says, Catullus XXX. aelatus anuo Romae moritur.
There is nothing to contradict Jerome’s date for the birth ol
the poet, but unfortunately sor our belief in his entire accuracy,
a number os the poems of Catullus were clearly written later
than nc- 57, -some ol them at least as late as the end of the ’
year 55 nc, or the beginning of the year 54 (ag. cc. 11, 29, 53,
113). Jerome is, therefore, certainly wrong about the date ol
the poet’s death, and hence about at least one of the two other
statements, the date os his birth and his age at death. The
only scrap of evidence from other sources on these points is the
vague statement os Ovid that Catullus died young (Am. III. 9.
62 obuius lruic [in Elysio] laedere tuuenalia cinctus tempora
cum Caluo, docte Catulle, tato).

7. The poems os Catullus himself fumish us, however, with
some good negative evidence conceming the date ol his death.
lt probably occurred in the year 54 nc. In the first place,
there are no poems that clearly must have been written later
than the close os the year 55 no, or the earlier months oi the
year 54, nor any that are even capable os more ready explana-
tion, is a later date ior their composition be supposed. The re·
mark about the consulship of Vatinius (c, 52), which did not
take place till the end ol the year 47 nc, forms no exception
to this statement (cs. Commentary), and the prosecution ol
