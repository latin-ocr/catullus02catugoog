xlii INTRODUCTION.

which a part, with lives of Cato andos Atticus, is still extant,
but also ol other historical works (cf. c. 1. 6 n.) and of poems

(Plin. Ep. V. 3. 6).

65. Q. Hortensius Ortalus (114-50 rac), Cicero's greatest
rival as an orator, was also somewhat ol a historian <Ve11.11.
16. 3), and wrote erotic poems (ον. Tn'st. Il. 4415 Plin. Ep.
V. 3. 5), which the Greeks at me banquet of Antonius Julianus
(Gell. XIX. 9. 7) characterized as inuenusta, though they
admitted that Catullus and Calvus wrote some verses compara·
ble with those of Anacreon. Presuming, perhaps, upon his own
gius as a poet, Hortensius asked Catullus sor a poem (c. 65.
18-19), and the poet complied with the request, though with
an absence of compliment that indicates no intimate friendship
with his petitioner‚ whose much greater age and high position
gave him, however, the power to become an influentia] patron.
That the friendship made no progress seems to be indicated by
the nncomplimentary allusion to the verses of Hortensius in
c. 95. 3 (cf. however 6 25 adyta).

66. The Varus os c. ιο is apparently identical with the Varus
of c. 22, who is a friend of Catullus and a criticos poetry, if not
a poet himself. This may well be the distinguished Quintilius
Varus, the Angustan critic (Hor. Α. P. 438 ff.) and poet (Acro
and Comm. Cruq. on lm). He is called a native of Cre·
mona 3 and his death in ²3 rac. (according to Jerome) drew
srom Horace a touching address of sympathy to Vergil (Carm.
Ι. ²4)· Judged from the tone ol the passage in the Ars
Poea'ca, Quintilius must have been somewhat older than
Horace, while yet he could hardly have been born long, if at
all, besore Catullus. The attempt to identify the Varus of c. ro
and c. 22 with Alfenus Varus of c. 3ο is unsatisfactory.

67. The Manlius Torquatus, whose marriage with Vinia
Aurunculeia is celebrated in c. 61, was perhaps the L. Manlius
Torquatus whose father was consul in 65 rac. (cl. Hor. Cam.
ΙΙΙ. 21. 13 Epod. 13. 6), and who was himself praetor in 49.
He allied himself with me Pompeians, and was killed in Africa
