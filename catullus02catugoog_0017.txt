xii INTRODUcrtoN.

of life in the capital during this most active period in the his·
tory of Rome, there arose a school of writers who, though osten
conservatives in politics, were radicals in poetry. The tenden-
cies of the traditional Roman past were by them utterly disre-
garded Inspiration was drawn from the stirring life into which
they were plunged, as well as from the sympathetic study ol
the sources of poetic art among both the earlier Greeks and
the Alexandriam, As was to be expected, their models oi
rhythm were not the rude hexameters and ruder Saturnians os
their Roman predecessors, but the more polished versification
of the Greeks ; and their subjects were sometimes their own
personal experiences and emotions, and sometimes themes sug·

gested by their Greek prototypes. So a new school oi Roman
¹ poetry arose and floun'shed, to be superseded in turn by the
polished Augustans, who cultivated the niceties of elegance, but
at the expense osberne.

3. Oi this new school of poets the most prominent and
interesting figure is Catullus. Itis possible to know him per-
sonally as only now and then an ancient writer can be known
to us, and yet he gives us but few definite biographical facts
concerning himself, while still sewer are given by other authors
oi his own and later ages. But the little body of poems that
constitute his extant works is so replete with his intense person·
ality, and shows forth so unreservedly his every emotion, that
the man stands out before usas does no other man of the age
with the exception oi two or three of its political leaders. And
all this is true, even though we acknowledge‚ as we are bound
to do, that in many questions of importance concerning his tite
we must be content with a working hypothesis instead ofa
series of 'established facts, and that the biographer, as the
interpreter oi the poems of Catullus, must be understood to be·
presenting probabilities, and not certainties.
