of all poems (except c. 11) showing a change of personal, il
not of political, feeling? But this question may be reserved
for another occasion.

51. It is not to be supposed, however, that allos these poems
saw the light for the first tirne after the death of their author.
The manifest point of most of the personal poems would have
been utterly lost, had they not been published immediately
after their composition, and the passage already cited from
Suetonius (lul. 73) shows clearly that Caesar was acquainted
before their author’s death with some of the poems directed
against him. One poem also (c. 16. 12) contains an evident
reference to the earlier publication of c. 48 (or of cc. 5 and
7?). It seems likely, therefore, that many of the poenis were
published singly, at least among the circle of the poet’s friends,
while the extant dedication ofa libellus to Cornelius Nepos
suggests that a smaller collection of thern was made and pub-
lished by Catullus himself (cf. introductory note to c. ι).

52. Catullus undoubtedly wrote other poems than those
included in the extant liber, but of the fragments attributed to
him by the grammarians some are proved to have been falsely
so ascribed, and the few remaining are, even if genuine, so
slight as to be insignificant (cf. Commentary on cc. 18-21).

53. The popularity enjoyed by Catullus among the Augustan
elegiasts did not preserve his memory alive through the declin-
ing centuries of the Roman empire. The scholars and poets of
the latter half of the first millennium after Christ had forgotten
even his name. Only Rather, bishop of Verona, in a sermon
delivered there in 965 no, confesses that he had just become
acquainted with his writings; andan anthology of Latin poets
written at about the same time (now cod Thuaneus, Pan'sinus
8071) contains a single poem of Catullus (c. 62). Then he
drops out of ken once more till the opening of the 14th cen·
