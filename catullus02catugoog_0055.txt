d. thros in thesis is found in cc. 66. 11 naua auctus‚· 68. .
158 prz'nra amnia,· 107.1 cupida aptanti. In cc. ²7· 4, 66. 48, ¹
and 97. 2, it occurs in the MSS„ but not in the emended text
here presented. Hiatus in arsis occurs in ce. ιο. 27 mane
inquii,· 5 5. 4 te in ‚· 97. 1 di ament ,· 114. 6 dama ipse.

e. Svsrona of final a is not uncomm0n‚ especially in verbs.
In ro. 26 cammadd (imperative) occurs.

f Drasroca occurs in cc. 64. 360 tepefactet, and 90. 6 lr'que·
faciens (but cf. 68. 29 tepefactet).

g. In c. 116. 8 dabis final s does not make position with the
initial consonant following ; and in c. 23· ²7 the reading of V,
satis beatus, is probably correct, representing satis bearu’s (ie.
beatas es). In cc. 62. 4, 64. 20, and 66. 11 a final syllable
ending in a single consonant is lengthened in thesis before
hymenaeus. Afinal syllable ending in a short vowel is thrice
lengthened in thesis before a mute followed by r (in cc. 4. 9
Propontida trucem ,· 4. 18 impotentia freta ,· 29. 4 ultima
Britanm'a); and it is noticeable that all these 'instances occur
in pure (i) iambics. A similar syllable is lengthened in thesis

before initials followed by a 'consonant in cc. 17. 24 pote ³

stolidum ,· 22. ramado scurra ; 44. 18 nefaria emptas· 63. 53
gelida stabula ,· 64. 186 nulla spes,· 67. 32 supposita speculae.
But Catullus is not careful to follow out this rule of position in
all cases, any more than he is consistent in instances of systole
and diastole, or in such cases as ec. 43. 2 nigras, bnt 68. 63
nigra,· and especially 71. 2 podagra, but 71. 6 padcigra. In
these minor matters he allows himself greater freedom than
either Lucretius or the later poets, and the same liberty is
seen in the greater matters concerned with his treatment ¹of
merres, His graceful command of rhythm was sar removed ·
y from the fixed formalities adopted by the Augustans.
