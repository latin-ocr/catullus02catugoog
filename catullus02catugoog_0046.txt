less probability may be attributed to him the work on the deri·
vation of the names os the gods ascribed by Macrobius aud
Priscian to an author os his name: but the verse in criticism
of a grammatical point in Vergil attributed by Cledonius (V.
43. 2) to Cornificius Gallus may have been written, as some
have thought, by Cornelius Gallus. Only two fragments of the
verses of Cornificius have been preserved, one a hendecasylla-
bic (Macr. VI. 4. ra), and the other the latter part os a
hexameter from his Glaucus (Macr. VI. 5. 13). They are
appended by L. Mtiller to his edition oi Catullus

’ 62. The Cato to whom c. 56 is addressed was probably not
that pattern os ancient Roman strictness‚ M. Porcius Cato,
later called Uticensis, but the grammarian, Valerius Cato, who
was a countryman os Catullus (Suet. Grom. rr), and whose
amatory poems are mentioned by Ovid (unte. II. 436) in
connection with those oi Cinna (ef. ξ 63), Comilicius (cs.
ἕ 61), and Anser.

63. C. Helvius Cinna, a companion of Catullus on the stall
os Memmius (cic.10.3o and ξ 30), whose epic poem, the
Zmyrna, is praised in c. 95, was probably the Caesarian tribune
mistaken for L. Cornelius Cinna, the anti-Caesarian, in the riots

attending the funeral os Julius Caesar, and killed by the popu-
lace (Plut. Brut. 20, Iul. 68; Suet. Iul. 85 ; cf. Shakspere Jul.
Ceos. ΙΙΙ. 3). The insignificant extant fragments oi his poems
are appended by L. Mliller to his edition of Catullus. ¹

64. The Cornelius os e. 1. 1 seems to be Cornelius Nepos, the
historian; witness Ausonius, who says (XXIII. r-3l ‘ Cui. . .
libellum ’ Veronensis aitpoeta quondam, irruenteque dedit statim
Nepoti. Nepos (circ. 94-24 ac.) was certainly a provincial
from Cisalpine Gaul (Plin. N. H. Ill. 1²7 Nepos Padi accolo),
and probably a native of Ticinum (Plin. Ep. IV. 28. 13
Mommsen in Hermes 111. p. 62). His acquaintance with
Catullus, though nothing certain can be traced conceming it,
was doubtless sostered by their similarity of origin (cf.§ 12).
Nepos was author not only of the work De Viris suasoribus, oi
