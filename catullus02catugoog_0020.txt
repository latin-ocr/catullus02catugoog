INTRODUCI'ION. xv

Vatinius by Calvus, mentioned in c. 53, may well have taken
place in 56 rae, instead of in the fall of 54. Furthermore,
c. rr, which was surely written toward the close of 55 ne,
shows a decided change in the feeling of Catullus toward
Caesar, and accords well with the statement of Suetonius (lul.
73), that after Catullus had angered Caesar by his epigrams
concerning him and Mamurra, a reconciliation with the poet
took place, apparently at his father’s house at Verona. It is
hardly credible that if Catullus lived during the exciting years
that followed 55 ne, the only indication of his new feeling
toward Caesar should be the reference in c. 11, and that this
was followed by silence. Such neutrality was not the fashion
among the young friends whom Caesar was constantly winning
to himself from the ranks of his political opponents. There
seems, indeed, to be an indication in c. rr that Catullus might
be expecting some post under the great commander. But the
most satisfactory conclusion is that death came within a short
time after the close ol 55 rac, and anticipated all hopedfor
activities (cf, however, 5 5ο).

8. Whether Jerome is wrong in one or in both of his other
statements, remains, and must always remain, in doubt. All
known facts concerning Catullus harmoniae well with the
hypothesis that he was bom in 87, and died in 54 rac, at
the age of thirty-three, or that he was born in 84, and died
in 54, at the age of thirty 3 but nothing more definite can be
said about the matter.

9. The only relative mentioned by Catullus is his brother,

· whose death was the occasion to him of such intense and last·

ing grief (cc. 65, 68, 101). But Suetonius (fc.) speaks of the
father as a host of Julius Caesar even so late, apparently, as the
close of the poet’s life. Why he (to say nothing of the mother)
is never mentioned by the poet, we cannot tell. Not improb-
ably, however, he did not have the same active sympathy with
