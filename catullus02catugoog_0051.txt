inwhich Caesar received news of his death (so Nipperdey inter·
prets the allusion). The connection of Mamurra with the pro·

vincial Ameana (cce 41, 43) may be assigned to the time when
he was in attendance upon Caesar in his winter journeys to the
nearer province.

7'5. The poet Volusius of cc. 36 and 95 is probably not to be

identified with Tanusius Geminus, as* Muretus and other later
writers would have it. The only ground for such identification
is a remark made by Seneca (Ep. 93. 11 annales Tanusii scis
quam ponderosi sint et quid nocentur). Butos all the names
that appear in Catullus, Lesbia and Lesbius are the onlyones
known to be pseudonyms (for Mentula ishardly a name, but an
easily recognized epithet). Andithe quid uocantur of Seneca
may readily refer to some other popular characterization of the
work of the annalist, and not to the cacata charta of c. 36. 1.

Mernas

The metres employed by Catullus are as follows : -
76. Dncrvuc Haxaurrnn (cc. 62, 64) and Eusenos (cc. ⁶5-

116). The occurrence of spondaic verses is very frequent,and κ

doubtless is due to Alexandrian influence. In all, there are
4² such verses, of which 34 end in a quadrisyllable. ¹In only
ten instances is this a proper name. In c. 64 there is a suc· ἵ
cession of three spondaic verses (vv.· 78-80).—The tendency

to employ a succession of spondeus in the same verse is strika ¹
- ing. 'llrus c. 116. 3 is made up entirely of spondees, and 71
verses have spondees in the first four places—The ‘penthe- ἶ
mimeral caesura is by far the favoritet though the hephthe- ἵ

mimeral occurs occasionally3 and the feminine caesura in Athe
third soot is not unknown, though it is entirely excluded from

the fourth. -The hexameters end preferably in a 'dissyllable ’

or trisyllable, but in the ending of the ⁸pentameters greater
freedom is allowed. —- Hypermeters· are found in c. 64. 298
