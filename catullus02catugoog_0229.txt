of a conversation-between the poet
and the door of a certain house,
abounds in difficulties of interpreta-
tion for us, though its directness of
personal reference must have made
it clear enough to the Veronese.

notes): The Door is that of a
house in Verona (v. 34), formerly
owned by an aged (v. 4) bachelor
or widower (v. 6) named Balbus,
after whose death (v. 6) it came
into the possession of his son (v. r)
Caecilius, who thereupon married
(v. 6) and brought horne a young
and lively widow (v. 20) from Brixia
(v. 32), who claimed to be also a
maid (v. 19). Strange rumors
about her life soon began to spread
through Verona, and the poet in·

woman was a had lot before she

son’s place iu the household‚ and
the woman moreover was too in·
